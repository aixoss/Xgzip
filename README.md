Xgzip
======

The Xgzip utility compress and decompress files. This Xgzip differs from the GNU gzip data compression program (gzip) where the former uses zlib APIs to achieve the compression & decompression and the latter one uses it's own compression logic. This software is originally developed to exploit the hardware accelerated zlib library but it can work with the general zlib library as well.

The gzip base code is actually taken from https://github.com/ibm-genwqe/genwqe-user and modified to suit the purpose.

Any issues seen with the application can be reported at https://github.com/aixoss/Xgzip
